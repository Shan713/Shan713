# 👋 Hi, I'm Shantharam P!

I'm a **3rd year undergraduate student** passionate about **Semantics, Knowledge Graphs, IoT, Embedded Systems**, and **Edge Computing**. I love bridging the gap between the physical layer (hardware, sensors) and the conceptual layer (ontologies, knowledge representation) to build truly intelligent, real-world systems.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus
- 🧠 **Knowledge Representation & Semantics**:  
  Modeling domain knowledge with OWL ontologies, Protégé, and reasoning systems to power intelligent applications.
- 🌐 **Knowledge Graph Backends**:  
  Experimenting with triple stores like GraphDB for advanced semantic querying and linked data integration.
- 📡 **IoT & Embedded Systems**:  
  Building projects with sensors, actuators, and control logic using Arduino + PlatformIO to interface with the physical world.
- 🧮 **Edge Computing**:  
  Simulating fog/edge-layer architectures for real-time, decentralized decision-making at the network edge.

## 🧠 Technical Skills
**Languages:**  
Python, C, C++, JavaScript, SQL

**Frameworks & Tools:**  
Django (basic), Pandas, Matplotlib, Git, Arduino, PlatformIO, iFogSim2, Protégé, GraphDB

**Concepts:**  
Ontologies, Semantic Web, Embedded Programming, Edge Architectures, Data Structures & Algorithms, Theory of Computation, DBMS

## 💡 About Me
As an **ENFJ**, I thrive in structured, collaborative environments and value systems that combine logic with purpose. My passion lies in uniting the abstract (semantics, graphs) with the practical (IoT, embedded systems) to create solutions that are both meaningful and functional.

- I enjoy diving deep into tech stacks that connect hardware and knowledge-driven software.
- I believe in lifelong learning and am always open to new ideas and team projects.
- Beyond tech, I love mentoring, writing, and exploring how technology shapes society.
